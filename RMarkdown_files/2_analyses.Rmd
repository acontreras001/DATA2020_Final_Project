# Introduction
This document provides an overview of the analyses conducted on the project dataset.

## Dependency Setup
```{r Dependency Setup, inlcude = TRUE}

if (!require("here")) install.packages("here")
library(here)

# Set current working directory to .rmd file location
setwd(here::here())

#Print current worlking directory in case not connected to .Rproj file
print(getwd())

# Define the path to the .renv lockfile within the 'renv' folder
renv_lockfile <- file.path(getwd(), "renv.lock")

#Restore packages from renv lock file
if (!require("renv")) install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()

# Use the p_load function to install and load any desired packages that may not 
# have been in the renv.lock file. Note, if the packages were already in the 
# renv.lock file, that is okay. `p_load` will not change version number

if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(renv, rmarkdown,  knitr, tidyverse, reshape2, 
               gridExtra, broom, car, caret, Metrics)

# Update the renv lock file
renv::snapshot()
```
